247Chess stream

Initial Idea:
I think a 24/7 YouTube stream that streams top grandmaster games from live chess + chill music in the background, with a dynamic title depending on who its following would be great content. It could be something people fall asleep to or go to chat with the community
If it picks up, there’s potential for ad revenue too
Unlimited content
It’s like lichess tv but more community oriented

Implementation Details:
Two ways:
First way:
Find a way to follow top player in time control
Get the usernames of those players
Get real names of those players
Modify title of stream
Second way:
Get leaderboard on an interval
Starting from top, query endpoint to see if they are playing live
If they are, get the live game link and display it somehow.
Get the players names and modify the title of the stream.
If they stop playing, repeat the process
